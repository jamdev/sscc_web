        Thinking of coming along? No experience is necessary, just a willingness
        to learn. We welcome all levels of experience. We don't mind what you
        shoot, from camera phones to pro kit. Just turn up and have fun!
    </p>
    <p>We meet on alternate Mondays at 7.30pm. Our next meeting is:</p>
    <Calendar
        events={events}

    <h4>Cost</h4>
    <p>
        We charge Â£3 per meeting, on the door. This helps us cover the cost of
        the venue and equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Note, we do not currently charge a membership fee but we are
        considering our options as we grow. We are an unincorporated association
        and all monies are used for the benefit of the club.)
    </p>
    <h4>Parking</h4>
    <p>
        There is free parking available in the church car park (first come first
        served). Shenstone has some on-street parking available but please be
        respectful to residents. Alternatively, there is paid parking in the
        nearby station car park.
